# JPMC Advanced Software Engineering Job Simulation

This project showcases my completion of the **Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience** designed by **J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.** and hosted on Forage.

Each task is maintained in a separate public repository to preserve original forks and contributions from JPMC’s official starter templates. These projects simulate how engineers at JPMC use live data to support trading decisions.

While I completed this experience early in my journey, I’ve since revisited the code to clean it up, modernize the structure, and improve usability.
