# JPMC Software Engineering - Advanced

**Status**: ✅ Completed

This project represents completion of the **Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience** designed by **J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.** and hosted on Forage.

## Program Overview

This virtual experience program simulated how engineers at JPMC use live data to support trading decisions. The program consisted of three tasks focused on real-time data feeds, financial data visualization, and full-stack integration.

**Note**: The completed tasks are maintained in separate forked repositories to preserve the original project structure and demonstrate participation in the program.
