# JPMC Advanced Software Engineering Job Simulation

This section contains my completion of the J.P. Morgan Chase **Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience** hosted on Forage.

Each task is kept in a separate public repo to preserve the fork and contribution history directly from JPMC’s official starter repos.

## 🔗 Tasks

- [Task 1 – Interface with the Stock Price Data Feed](https://github.com/dhu2022-dev/jpmc-swe-task-1)
- [Task 2 – Use JPMorgan Chase’s Perspective Tool](https://github.com/dhu2022-dev/jpmc-swe-task-2)
- [Task 3 – Open Pull Request](https://github.com/dhu2022-dev/jpmc-swe-task-3)

> 📌 These tasks were intentionally left in their original forked repositories to reflect their source and ensure public verification of participation.

## 📝 Notes

The experience covered:
- Handling live stock price feeds
- React/JavaScript frontend integration
- Financial data visualization
- GitHub-based collaboration & pull request workflow
