# Task 5: Daily Standups

## Overview

This task covers the Daily Scrum (Daily Standup) ceremony, including purpose, format, best practices, and common anti-patterns.

## Key Concepts Learned

### What is a Daily Standup?

The Daily Standup (or Daily Scrum) is a 15-minute time-boxed event where the Development Team:
- Synchronizes activities
- Plans work for the next 24 hours
- Identifies impediments
- Inspects progress toward the Sprint Goal

### Purpose of Daily Standup

- Increase communication and transparency
- Identify and remove blockers quickly
- Keep team aligned on sprint goals
- Promote team accountability
- Surface issues early

### Standard Format

Each team member typically answers three questions:

1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?**
   - Share completed work
   - Demonstrate progress

2. **What will I work on today?**
   - Communicate plans
   - Set expectations

3. **Are there any impediments or blockers?**
   - Surface issues that need attention
   - Request help if needed

### Best Practices

**Timing:**
- Same time every day (usually morning)
- Time-boxed to 15 minutes
- Consistent location or video call

**Format:**
- Stand up (promotes brevity) or use video for remote teams
- Keep updates concise and focused
- Focus on work, not status reports to managers

**Participation:**
- Development Team members are required
- Product Owner may attend (as observer)
- Scrum Master facilitates but doesn't control
- Managers and stakeholders should not attend

**Content:**
- Focus on sprint backlog items
- Mention collaboration and dependencies
- Be honest about blockers
- Update tasks on board if using one

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Status Report Meeting**
   - Problem: Reporting to manager instead of coordinating with team
   - Solution: Focus on coordination, not reporting

2. **Problem-Solving Session**
   - Problem: Discussing solutions in detail
   - Solution: Identify blockers, discuss solutions after standup

3. **Going Over Time**
   - Problem: Meeting exceeds 15 minutes
   - Solution: Time-box strictly, follow up separately if needed

4. **Manager-Driven**
   - Problem: Manager asking questions or directing work
   - Solution: Team-driven, Scrum Master facilitates

5. **Reading from Board**
   - Problem: Just reciting what's on the board
   - Solution: Provide meaningful updates and context

6. **Vague Updates**
   - Problem: "Working on stuff" or "Making progress"
   - Solution: Be specific about work items

### Effective Standup Practices

- Update the board/backlog tool during or right after
- Keep it conversational, not robotic
- Make it visible (use physical or digital board)
- Encourage collaboration and offer help
- Celebrate small wins
- Connect updates to sprint goal

### Handling Blockers

When a blocker is identified:
- Note it during standup
- Don't solve it during the meeting
- Assign someone to address it (often Scrum Master)
- Follow up after standup for detailed discussion
- Track blockers to identify patterns

### Remote/Distributed Teams

Best practices for remote standups:
- Use video when possible
- Ensure good audio quality
- Use shared board/backlog tool
- Respect time zones if global team
- Keep camera on for engagement
- Use screen sharing to show boards

---

**Key takeaway**: Daily standups are 15-minute team coordination meetings (not status reports) where team members share what they did, what they'll do, and any blockers. The focus is on collaboration and removing impediments, not reporting to management. Effective standups keep teams aligned and help deliver sprint goals.
