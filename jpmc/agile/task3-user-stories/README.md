# Task 3: User Stories

## Overview

This task covers how to write effective user stories, including structure, acceptance criteria, and best practices for managing them.

## Key Concepts Learned

### What is a User Story?

A user story is a brief description of functionality from the end user's perspective. It follows a simple template:

**As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].**

Example:
- "As a banking customer, I want to view my account balance so that I can track my finances."

### Components of a User Story

1. **Role/Persona**: Who wants the feature?
2. **Action/Capability**: What do they want to do?
3. **Benefit/Value**: Why do they want it?

### INVEST Criteria

Good user stories should be:
- **I**ndependent: Can be developed in any order
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed and changed
- **V**aluable: Delivers value to the user/customer
- **E**stimable: Team can estimate effort
- **S**mall: Can be completed in a single sprint
- **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

### Acceptance Criteria

Clear conditions that must be met for the story to be considered done:

- Written from the user's perspective
- Specific and testable
- Define the boundaries of the story
- Help clarify requirements

Example:
- Given I am logged in
- When I navigate to my account page
- Then I can see my current balance

### Story Points

A relative estimation technique:
- Represents effort, complexity, and risk
- Not time-based (2 points ≠ 2 hours)
- Uses Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Helps with planning and velocity tracking

### Epics and Themes

- **Epic**: Large user story that spans multiple sprints
  - Must be broken down into smaller stories
  - Example: "As a customer, I want comprehensive mobile banking"

- **Theme**: Collection of related stories
  - Groups stories by feature or business capability
  - Helps organize and prioritize work

### Writing Effective User Stories

Best practices:
- Write from the user's perspective
- Keep it simple and focused
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Discuss details in conversation
- Focus on value delivered
- Avoid technical implementation details initially

### Common Pitfalls

- Too vague or too detailed
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Written from developer perspective
- Too large to complete in one sprint
- Including implementation details

---

**Key takeaway**: User stories capture requirements from the user's perspective using the format "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]." They should be INVEST-compliant, include acceptance criteria, and be sized appropriately for a single sprint. They facilitate conversation and focus on delivering value.
