# Task 6: Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives

## Overview

This task covers the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective ceremonies, including their purposes, formats, and best practices.

## Key Concepts Learned

### Sprint Review

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders
- Gather feedback on the increment
- Inspect what was accomplished
- Adapt the Product Backlog based on feedback

**Key Characteristics:**
- Time-boxed (typically 2-4 hours for a 2-week sprint)
- Informal presentation, not a formal status meeting
- Focus on the increment (working software)
- Collaborative discussion with stakeholders

### Sprint Review Format

**Typical Agenda:**
1. **Review Sprint Goal**: What was planned to be accomplished
2. **Demonstrate Increment**: Show working software/features
3. **Discuss What Was Done**: Highlight completed Product Backlog items
4. **Gather Feedback**: Get stakeholder input
5. **Product Backlog Updates**: Discuss what might come next

**Participants:**
- Development Team (presents the work)
- Product Owner (facilitates, manages backlog)
- Scrum Master (ensures event happens, removes impediments)
- Stakeholders (provide feedback)
- Key users and customers

**Best Practices:**
- Demonstrate actual working software, not slides
- Show both successes and what didn't get done
- Encourage honest feedback
- Focus on business value delivered
- Make it interactive, not just a presentation
- Keep it informal and collaborative

### Sprint Retrospective

**Purpose:**
- Inspect how the team worked together
- Identify improvements to process and practices
- Plan actionable improvements for next sprint
- Strengthen team collaboration and effectiveness

**Key Characteristics:**
- Time-boxed (typically 1-3 hours for a 2-week sprint)
- Safe space for honest discussion
- Team-focused (only Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner)
- Results in concrete action items

### Sprint Retrospective Format

**Common Retrospective Frameworks:**

**Start-Stop-Continue:**
- What should we **start** doing?
- What should we **stop** doing?
- What should we **continue** doing?

**What Went Well / What Could Improve:**
- Celebrate successes
- Identify areas for improvement
- Generate action items

**Mad, Sad, Glad:**
- What made us frustrated (Mad)?
- What disappointed us (Sad)?
- What made us happy (Glad)?

**4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For):**
- What did we **like**?
- What did we **learn**?
- What did we **lack**?
- What do we **long for**?

**Typical Flow:**
1. **Set the Stage** (5 min): Create safe environment
2. **Gather Data** (10-20 min): Collect insights from sprint
3. **Generate Insights** (15-30 min): Identify patterns and root causes
4. **Decide What to Do** (15-30 min): Create actionable improvement items
5. **Close** (5 min): Summarize and commit to actions

### Retrospective Best Practices

- Create psychological safety
- Focus on process, not people
- Be constructive and solution-oriented
- Limit action items (1-3 is ideal)
- Make action items specific and assign owners
- Follow up on previous action items
- Celebrate wins and progress
- Use facilitation techniques to engage everyone

### Common Retrospective Pitfalls

1. **Complaint Session**
   - Problem: Only focusing on problems
   - Solution: Balance with what's working well

2. **No Action Items**
   - Problem: Discussing but not committing to change
   - Solution: Always end with concrete next steps

3. **Ignoring Previous Actions**
   - Problem: Not following up on past commitments
   - Solution: Review previous action items at start

4. **Blaming Individuals**
   - Problem: Personal attacks
   - Solution: Focus on process and systems

5. **Too Many Action Items**
   - Problem: Overwhelming the team
   - Solution: Prioritize and limit to 1-3

### The Sprint Cycle

Understanding how ceremonies connect:
1. **Sprint Planning**: Select and plan work
2. **Daily Standups**: Coordinate daily
3. **Sprint Work**: Execute the plan
4. **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate and get feedback
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: Improve process
6. **Repeat**: Apply learnings to next sprint

---

**Key takeaway**: Sprint Reviews demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback to adapt the backlog. Sprint Retrospectives are team-only meetings to inspect the process and create improvement action items. Both ceremonies are essential for continuous improvement and stakeholder engagement in Agile development.
