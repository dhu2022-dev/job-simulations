# Task 2: Scrum at JPMC

## Overview

This task covers the Scrum framework and how it's implemented at J.P. Morgan Chase, including roles, ceremonies, and artifacts.

## Key Concepts Learned

### Scrum Framework

Scrum is an Agile framework for managing complex work. It provides structure through defined roles, ceremonies, and artifacts.

### Scrum Roles

1. **Product Owner**
   - Represents stakeholders and customers
   - Manages the Product Backlog
   - Prioritizes work based on business value
   - Makes final decisions on product features

2. **Scrum Master**
   - Facilitates Scrum ceremonies
   - Removes impediments blocking the team
   - Ensures Scrum practices are followed
   - Coaches the team on Agile principles
   - Acts as a servant-leader

3. **Development Team**
   - Cross-functional group that does the work
   - Self-organizing and self-managing
   - Typically 5-9 members
   - Committed to delivering increments each sprint

### Scrum Ceremonies

1. **Sprint Planning**
   - Team selects work from Product Backlog
   - Creates Sprint Backlog
   - Defines Sprint Goal
   - Typically 2-4 hours for a 2-week sprint

2. **Daily Standup (Daily Scrum)**
   - 15-minute daily meeting
   - Each team member answers: What did I do? What will I do? Any blockers?
   - Keeps team aligned and identifies impediments

3. **Sprint Review**
   - Demonstrates completed work to stakeholders
   - Gathers feedback
   - Inspects the increment

4. **Sprint Retrospective**
   - Team reflects on process
   - Identifies improvements
   - Plans action items for next sprint

### Scrum Artifacts

1. **Product Backlog**
   - Ordered list of all work items
   - Maintained by Product Owner
   - Continuously refined

2. **Sprint Backlog**
   - Selected Product Backlog items for the sprint
   - Plan for delivering the increment
   - Owned by Development Team

3. **Increment**
   - Sum of all completed Product Backlog items
   - Must be in "Done" state
   - Potentially shippable

### Definition of Done

Criteria that must be met for work to be considered complete:
- Code completed and reviewed
- Tests written and passing
- Documentation updated
- Acceptance criteria met
- Potentially deployable

---

**Key takeaway**: Scrum provides structure to Agile through defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), ceremonies (planning, standups, reviews, retrospectives), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment). The framework enables iterative delivery with regular inspection and adaptation.
