# Task 1: Introduction to Agile

## Overview

This task introduces the foundational concepts of Agile methodologies, including the Agile Manifesto and its core principles.

## Key Concepts Learned

### Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto consists of four core values:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
   - Emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration
   - Tools support the team, but people drive success

2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
   - Deliver value to customers through functional products
   - Documentation is important but should support, not hinder, delivery

3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
   - Ongoing partnership with stakeholders
   - Respond to changing requirements rather than rigid contracts

4. **Responding to change** over following a plan
   - Embrace change as a natural part of development
   - Plans are guides, not strict roadmaps

### Twelve Agile Principles

1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Collaboration between business people and developers daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals; give them support and trust
6. Face-to-face conversation is most effective
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—maximize the amount of work not done
11. Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures and designs
12. Regular reflection and adaptation for effectiveness

### Agile vs. Waterfall

- **Waterfall**: Sequential, plan-heavy, rigid, document-driven
- **Agile**: Iterative, flexible, adaptive, collaboration-driven

### Benefits of Agile

- Faster time to market
- Better quality through continuous testing and feedback
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Enhanced team collaboration and morale
- Ability to adapt to changing requirements

**Key takeaway**: Agile prioritizes individuals, collaboration, working software, and adaptability over rigid processes and plans. The methodology emphasizes iterative delivery and responding to change.
