# 💼 Job Simulations

This repo collects various job simulations and virtual experience programs I’ve completed to build practical skills in software engineering, data science, and related fields.

These bite-sized projects simulate real tasks from companies like J.P. Morgan Chase and more.

## 🏦 J.P. Morgan Chase

- [`/jpmc/quant`](./jpmc/quant) – Quantitative analysis simulation
- [`/jpmc/swe-advanced`](./jpmc/swe-advanced) – Advanced SWE virtual experience (links to forked tasks)
- `/jpmc/swe-beginner` – *Coming soon*

## 🧠 More to Come

More simulations from other companies (e.g., Goldman Sachs, BCG, Citadel) will be added here as I complete them.
