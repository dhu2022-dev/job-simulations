## Overview

These simulations provide hands-on experience with industry-standard technologies and practices, demonstrating proficiency in:

- **Backend Development**: Spring Boot, Kafka, REST APIs, database design
- **Data Science & Quantitative Finance**: Time series forecasting, financial modeling, statistical analysis
- **Software Engineering**: Clean code practices, testing, system architecture

## Projects

### J.P. Morgan Chase

#### [Midas Core - Transaction Processing](./jpmc/swe-midas) 🚧 In Progress

**Tech Stack**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2.5, Apache Kafka, JPA/H2, Maven

Transaction processing system using Kafka for real-time event streaming. Building a system that receives financial transactions via Kafka, processes them to update user balances, and provides balance query capabilities.

- **Status**: In progress
- **Key Features**: Kafka consumer/producer setup, transaction processing, database persistence, REST API for balance queries

#### [Trading Dashboard - Perspective](./jpmc/swe-perspective) ✅ Completed

**Tech Stack**: Python, React, Perspective (JPMC frameworks)

JPMC Software Engineering simulation focused on interfacing with real-time stock price data feeds and building trading dashboards using JPMC's Perspective framework.

- **Status**: Completed
- **Key Features**: Real-time data feeds, financial data visualization, full-stack integration

#### [Quantitative Research](./jpmc/quant) ✅ Completed

**Tech Stack**: Python, pandas, numpy, statsmodels (SARIMA), matplotlib

Natural gas price prediction and contract pricing models using time series analysis and financial modeling.

- **Status**: Tasks 1-2 completed
- **Key Features**: SARIMA forecasting, multi-date contract pricing, data visualization

### Goldman Sachs

#### [Software Engineering](./goldman-sachs/swe) 📋 Placeholder

Currently a placeholder for future work.
